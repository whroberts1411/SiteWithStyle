        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">I originally qualified as a dental surgeon, but didn't like it much. So after 11 years working
          in general practice, I switched careers to software development, where I worked for about
          25 years, and enjoyed it immensely. In my spare time, I enjoy walking, photography, programming and astronomy.

          <h3>Software Development</h3>
          <p>I have worked on all sorts of computer systems, starting with the Sinclair ZX80, and progressing through
            various other home computers to ICL mainframes and then the ubiquitous Windows PCs. In my time, I've used
            a large number of programming languages and technologies, including VB.Net, SQL, C++, Cobol, Pascal, Java
            and Python.

          <h3>Photography</h3>
          <p>I do quite a lot of digital photography, usually as part of my other hobbies, mainly walking and astronomy.
            I've been on a lot of walking holidays to various parts of Europe and the UK, and generally take hundreds of
            photos while out and about. I'm also trying to learn a bit about night-time photography, with a
            varying degree of success - light pollution is an increasing problem.

          <img class="hiker" src="images/walker.png" alt="walker">
          <h3>Walking</h3>
          <p>I walk about 6 miles or so every day with our dog, on the common land and hills to the north of where we
            live.
            I also like to go off to new places every month or so for a longer walk, generally about 12 miles or more.
            I've
            walked in quite a few places in Europe, including the Azores, Italy, Germany, France, Iceland and Norway.
